# AI-Final-Project


Basic Idea Of this project is to use and utilize Python modules to train model input and predict brain shrinkage in that.
The programming Language used is python and Tensorflow which is a python Module for deep learning was used to Create and Train the model that predicts the brain shrinkage.

The model takes a single scan as an input and the output a prediction (NORMAL or SHIRNKAGE)

The model was trained for 200 epochs,at  the end of the evaluation (with a new set of data), the model was able to achieve 79.59% accuracy
